	/// <summary>
	/// The Variable class holds the TFOutput nodes that are used to initialize, read and assign a value to a variable.   
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// A variable maintains state in the graph across calls to `run()`. You add a
	/// variable to the graph by constructing an instance of the class `Variable`.
	/// 
	/// The `Variable()` constructor requires an initial value for the variable,
	/// which can be a `Tensor` of any type and shape. The initial value defines the
	/// type and shape of the variable. After construction, the type and shape of
	/// the variable are fixed. The value can be changed using one of the assign
	/// methods.
	/// 
	/// When a variable is created a VarHandleOp is created which is returned as 
	/// the VariableOp property, an assign operation is created that can be accessed
	/// using the assignHandle and you can read the value of the variable using the
	/// ReadHandle.
	/// 
	/// When you launch the graph, variables have to be explicitly initialized before
	/// you can run Ops that use their value. You can initialize a variable by
	/// running its *initializer op*, restoring the variable from a save file, or
	/// simply running an `assign` Op that assigns a value to the variable. In fact,
	/// the variable *initializer op* is just an `assign` Op that assigns the
	/// variable's initial value to the variable itself.
	/// 
	/// There is an implicit conversion from the Variable into the VarHandleOp if
	/// used.
	/// </remarks>
